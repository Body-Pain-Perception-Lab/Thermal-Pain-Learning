# Markdown directory

This directory contains Markdown scripts for rerunning the Analysis for the manuscript. 

This includes the main analysis (Analysis.Rmd), the supplementary analysis (Supplementary Analysis.Rmd) and regenerating the plots (Plots.Rmd).

This is the main directory for investing the models and analyses conducted. 

Note that the directory heavily relies on the /scripts directory which contains custom made functions for plotting and extracting information.
