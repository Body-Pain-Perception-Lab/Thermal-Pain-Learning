# Shiny app directory

This directory contains code to investigate prior predictive checks for the computational learning models used in the manuscript. These can be found in the prior_predictive_checks.R script.

The Main way to investigate the the learning models is through running the Learning models.Rmd. 
This contains extra explanations for each model and points to the Shiny app made in the Shiny app.R script (which can also be run separately). 
It is recommended to click the "run document" button in the markdown to view the description and shiny app in an interactive html.
